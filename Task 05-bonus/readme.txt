Toss dice game rules:
1. Both the player and the computer roll two dice at the same time in each turn.
2. The sum of the two dice is calculated for both the player and the computer.
3. The player with the higher total score for that round wins the turn and receives 1 point.
4. If both totals are equal, no one gets a point.
5. The game continues until either the player or the computer reaches 7 points.
6. The first to reach 7 points wins the game.
7. Once the game ends, you can click the button again to reset and play a new game.
